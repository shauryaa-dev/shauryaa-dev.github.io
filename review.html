    <h1><b>SiteGround - Why Best So Far?</b></h1>
    
    <hr style="width:190px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">

<div class="w3-container" id="services" style="margin-top:10px;line-height: 2.0;margin-left:10px;margin-right: 10px;">
    <p align="justify">If you have gone through my blogging journey, So you must know that I have faced many failures during the time. After tons of reseearch & personal experiments, I found that site speed is one of the major factor to rank any page or site on search engine. In this article, I'm going to cover each and every point that I noticed about SiteGround that makes it #1 hosting company so far. As you know, I'm blogging since past 5 years & during that time SiteGround influence me that well that I switched most of my blogs onto their hosting. They provide great customer support & easy to use cpanel. There team are always ready 24/7 to provide great support. But that's not the only reason that you go with their hosting.</p>
   <p align="center">Ok, Let me ask you few questions,</p>
    <p align="center">&#128073Why you wanted to start your own blog?</p>
    <p align="center">&#128073Why WordPress for blogging?</p>
    <p align="center">Answer is simple, Because you wanna earn money, get traffic from search engine (organically). Right?. Do you know?, <mark>According to the report of Kissmetrics,</mark></p>

    <p align="center">- 47% of users expect that you website/blog to load in 2 seconds or less</p>

    <p align="center">- 40% expect to load in 3 second or less</p>
    <p align="justify">No one is going to wait longer than that, to load your webpage. As long as they request, your hosting must be capable enough to respond to them quickly. In case any person search on Google for any query and suppose your article is on the top, if that person tries to open your blog and failed for just 3 seconds then in 90% case, he/she immediately press the back button which results in increases of your bounce rate. To avoid all such circumstances & penalties, you must need a good hosting as well.</p>
    <p align="center"><mark>Now have a look at the official announcement made by Google</mark></p>

    <div class="w3-container" align="center">
  
   <img src="https://i.ibb.co/4pGGm9n/speed.png" alt="boy" class="w3-image" width="400" height="400" style="border:solid 3px;">
  
</div>
<p align="justify">According to reports, "Google will reduce the amount of crawlers it sends to your site if your server is slower than two seconds". No matter how many backlinks you have created or whats the quality of your content. Now Google will also count the site speed. So you also need to maintain it.</p>
<p align="justify">Now the question is <b>Which type of hosting is best for you & your blog?</b> i.e., Shared, Managed or Cloud?</p>
<p align="justify">Well there are different categories of hosting are available to host your WordPress blog. But 3 of the most popular types of hostings are <mark>"shared, managed & cloud".</mark></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Shared hosting</b> is just a type of hosting plan where your site “shares” resources with other sites on the same server. Whereas <b>Managed WordPress</b> hosting is a set of added services and performance tweaks that sits on top of regular hosting.</p>
<p align="justify">That’s why you can have cheap shared managed WordPress hosting – like Bluehost at ~$3 per month – and expensive dedicated managed WordPress hosts – like Pagely starting at $499 per month.</p>
